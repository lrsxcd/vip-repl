# client-server architecture -- concept #1 

This is a very basic example of sharing state across clients through one central server.

At the moment, we only the set of markers across leaflet maps, nothing more.

This is work in progress -- more will come.

## Inspiration

[Withshadow](../withshadow) for using [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org).

[Snake Lake](https://github.com/timothypratley/snakelake) for client-server architecture using [Sente](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente).

## Usage

Server:
``` shell
lein run
```

Client:
``` shell
yarn install
yarn watch
```

Open `localhost:8700` at two distinct browsers, try clicking the maps, and see them synchronize.
